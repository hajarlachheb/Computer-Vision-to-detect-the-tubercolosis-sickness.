The project is a Computer Vision Project to detect the tubercolosis sickness. 

This present report evaluates the potential use of medical imaging and digital image processing for the classification of lung images.
The work carried out and the models developed on each of the separate datasets have already achieved good prediction quality. Our objective is to build a model that performs a classification on the lung images of the two combined Datasets.
The bibliographic work and the analysis of formal and informal publications concerning the Dataset reveal to us various models which have been produced and some of which reach an accuracy of 97%, in particular that of the CNN model.
The work that we have done on the datasets consists mainly of importing the data, unifying the representation of the images and adjusting the sizes and bands of spectra used (RGB) to have homogeneous data.
Since our dataset is a database with three classes, it turned out to be more correct to adapt a model that already allows us to respectfully classify the 3 classes of the dataset. To finally arrive at a model capable of classifying the 3 classes of datasets indifferently.
The results obtained from the developed CNN model are respectively: an accuracy of 97%. The problem therefore is to try to increase the accuracy rate by using models that could predict whether the patient has Covid19 or a lung disease while implementing a convolutional neural network that operates on a Dataset of expanded images.
We were then able to achieve 98% accuracy on the test data. And a percentage that exceeds 90% at the level of other pretreated models. The proposed recommendations aim to improve this score by carrying out additional processing in order to avoid the degradation of image quality but also to propose a solution that will be implemented later in order to be a support for the medical staff.
